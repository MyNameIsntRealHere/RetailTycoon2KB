<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">I have this red-X symbol in my store</p>
<div class="ContentRow">
  <p class="ContentWimg">This icon means that one or more NPCs can't reach that place, so somewhere in your build the path from an NPC to that location is blocked. This blocked path can be anywhere on your plot, not only by this icon.<br><br>Here are some commom issues that can lead to a blocked path:<br>造 You used roof tiles as a flooring, try replacing that by a normal floor that is not a roofing tile.<br>造 NPCs can only pathfind vertically and horizontally, NOT diagonally. Keep that in mind when designing your store.<br>造 Shelving that is accessable via multiple side (like the spinning car display) need to be accessable via all sides at all times. Just having one side open is not enough.<br>造 There may be one or more NPCs trapped in a (enclosed) room or a customer in an employee-only zone.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">My walls are gone when loading my save / Some items didn't load in when loading a save</p>
<p class="ContentFull">If you run into this issue, it means that your store doesn't have the time to completely load in. Try playing in a private server by yourself and your walls should return.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">My NPCs disappear (partially) when going to the second floor</p>
<p class="ContentFull">This is a bug with the escalators in the game. If you replace those by normal stairs or elevators the problem will be resolved.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">My security guard is frozen in place</p>
<p class="ContentFull">This is a bug in the game, the best thing you can do is rejoin.<br><br>Playing the game in a private server MIGHT help to avoid this bug.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">My manager is not buying any items</p>
<p class="ContentFull">The usual issue is that the products are waiting at the loading bay, ready to be picked up by a delivery driver. Even when you have your manager on instant delivery it is still worth checking the loading bay to see if your manager ordered the items from a time you didn't have instant delivery turned on.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">My manager is occupying my finance reps desk and visa versa</p>
<div class="ContentRow">
  <p class="ContentWimg">Try replacing your desks with employee-specific desks instead of the any-employee desk you have (accedentally) placed now. It can be confusing since the any-employee desk looks the exact same as the finance rep-only desk.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">My janitor is complaining about trash bins even if I have placed multiple.</p>
<div class="ContentRow">
  <p class="ContentWimg">Your janitor is not asking for a trash bin, but for a dumpster. You can find this in the infrastructure tab in build mode. This is often a simple translation error.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">My money trees are not giving me the correct amount of extra money</p>
<p class="ContentFull">Money trees give a 2% increase on the PROFIT of items, not on the selling price. (profit = selling price - buying price)</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">I am unable to remove lights and other ceiling items in build mode</p>
<p class="ContentFull">In order to remove lights, you will need to navigate to the ceiling tab in build mode and then use the remove tool to remove them.</p>
