<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">What do they do?</p>
<p class="ContentFull">A finance rep is an <a onclick="loadPage('employees-aa-overview')">employee</a> you can hire to work in your store.<br><br>They give out loans to your customers so they can buy more expensive items. The more money a customer wants, the lower the chance they get the loan given.<br><br>The money you give out does not come from your own money.<br><br>Each time they level up, their work speed goes up by 10% (level 5: 40% faster).</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">Minimum loan</p>
<p class="ContentFull">In the employee settings you can set a minimum loan. This is the minimum amount of cash a customer needs in order to be able to see a finance rep.<br><br>This comes in handy if you don't have enough money for enough finance reps yet. If you set the amount for example on $500, customers that want to buy a car will be able to see a finance rep, but people that miss 2 bucks to buy another banana will not be able to see a finance rep.</p>
