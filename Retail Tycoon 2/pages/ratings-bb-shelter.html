<h2 class="ContentTitle">Shelter Rating</h2>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">What is based on?</p>
<p class="ContentFull">Your customers want a roof above their head and a wall to all 4 directions around them. If that is achieved you get 5 stars.</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">Walls and roofs everywhere, still not 5 stars?!?</p>
<p class="ContentFull">Your customers start giving out ratings the moment they arive in your store. That means that your parking lot also contributes to your ratings and requires some sort of shelter.</p>
