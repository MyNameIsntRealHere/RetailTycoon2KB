You can hire and fire employees via the employee menu at the top of the screen.<br><br>Employees level up when they work in your store, the higher their level, the quicker they can do their job.<br><br>Each of your employees gets a set salary per minute. The only time when you don't need to pay them is when your store is closed and all customers have left.<br>When you pause an employee, they will still take half of their salary.<br><br>There is no maximum amount of employees you can hire.</p>
