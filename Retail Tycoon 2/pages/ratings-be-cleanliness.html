<div class="ContentRow">
  <p class="ContentWimg">Your customers will periodically drop trash on the ground, but they don't like walking over that trash. You can help this by hiring <a onclick="loadPage('employees-bc-janitor')">janitors</a> and having trash bins spread around your store. Customers can litter on the ground on all spots that are not covered by a trash can or if the trash can(s) that cover that area are full.<br><br>You can see the coverage of your trash bins by using the overlay in the build menu (see image).</p>

<p class="ContentBetweenTitle">How to improve?</p>
<p class="ContentFull">Using the overlay, you can spot places where extra bins are needed to cover your whole store.<br>If you see litter on the ground close to a trash can it means that the trashcan covering that tile was full at the moment that piece of trash got dropped, you can then hire more janitors or place dumpsters on more accessable spots around your store.</p>
